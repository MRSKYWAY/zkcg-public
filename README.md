# ZK-Verified Computation Gateway (ZKCG)

**ZKCG enables non-ZK systems to replace trusted oracle logic with verifiable off-chain computation.**  
Instead of relying on a trusted backend or oracle signer, consumers (on-chain contracts or off-chain services) can accept results *only if* a zero-knowledge proof of correct computation and policy compliance is provided.

ZKCG is a protocol-first verification primitive — not a chain, not a zk-rollup, and not a signature oracle.  
It is designed for systems that want **trustless decision gating** using provable off-chain logic.

Learn more below 👇

## Motivation

In many systems today (DeFi risk checks, compliance gating, permissioned access), off-chain computation results are submitted on-chain or to services using trusted oracles or signed responses. This creates a trust assumption:

- Contracts must trust an oracle identity  
- Backends must be trusted not to lie  
- Private data often must be revealed for validation

ZKCG replaces this with **verifiable computation** — results accepted only if a zero-knowledge proof of correct execution *plus policy compliance* is provided.  
This eliminates the need for trust in a specific oracle signer and enables stronger guarantees for privacy and correctness.

## What ZKCG Replaces

Many systems today rely on trusted oracle services or backend signers to bring
off-chain computation results on-chain or into critical decision paths.

ZKCG replaces **trust in the computation provider** with **verifiable computation**.

| Today (Common Pattern) | With ZKCG |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Trusted oracle signer  | Zero-knowledge proof |
| Off-chain trust        | Cryptographic verification |
| Backend promises       | Enforced protocol policy |
| Revealed inputs        | Private inputs (ZK) |
| Ad-hoc validation      | Deterministic state transitions |

Instead of trusting *who* produced a result, consumers verify *how* it was produced.

## Overview

**ZKCG Verifier** is the public, auditable verification layer of the ZKCG protocol.
 
* **Phase 1**: Halo2-based zk-SNARK verification
* **Phase 2**: zkVM-based verification (RISC0)

This repository is intentionally **verifier-only**.
Anyone can independently verify proofs, audit the logic, and run verifier nodes.

---
## High-Level Architecture

Modern systems often rely on oracles or trusted services to bring off-chain results on-chain or into backend logic. ZKCG replaces those with verifiable proofs.

Here’s how a typical integration looks:

```
Off-chain computation
        ↓
   ZK proof generation
        ↓
   ZKCG Verifier
 (policy + proof check)
        ↓
Verified result consumed
(smart contract or service)
```

- The prover executes private logic off-chain and outputs a proof + public result.
- The verifier checks both **correct computation** and **policy compliance**.
- No trusted signer or back-end oracle identity is required.

---

## Example Integration: Oracle Replacement

Instead of:

```solidity
// Trusted oracle pattern
require(msg.sender == trustedOracle);
price = oraclePrice;
```

You can do:

```solidity
// Verifiable off-chain computation
require(verifyZKCG(proof, publicInputs));
price = publicInputs.price;
```

With ZKCG, the contract accepts the result only if a proof of correct computation
and policy compliance is provided — no need to trust a specific oracle address.

---

## Who Should Use ZKCG

ZKCG is built for systems that currently rely on externally computed results where:

- Trusting a specific oracle signer is undesirable
- Privacy of inputs must be preserved
- Proof of correct logic matters
- Existing systems already rely on oracles or trusted backends

Typical adopters include:

- On-chain protocols replacing oracle signatures
- Off-chain services needing strong correctness guarantees
- Compliance and eligibility systems
- Risk-based access gating

---

## Use Case (Phase 1): Private Eligibility Check

A common pattern across many systems is:

> “Can this user or entity execute some action *only if* their private data satisfies a condition?”

Examples include:

- Credit score ≥ threshold
- Age ≥ 18
- Compliance metric below risk limit
- Private reputation above requirement

ZKCG enables these decisions to be verified **without revealing private inputs**
and **without trusting an oracle signer**.

## Real-World Integration Example

ZKCG can be integrated into DeFi protocols for privacy-preserving verifications (e.g., credit score checks without revealing scores). See this demo in the [collateral_vault repository](https://github.com/MRSKYWAY/collateral_vault/blob/master/scripts/collateral_demo.ts), which shows the full on-chain + off-chain pipeline:

- **Off-Chain Proof Generation**: Generate a ZK proof using ZKCG's prover (Halo2 or zkVM) for conditions like "credit score > threshold".
- **Off-Chain Verification**: Call ZKCG's API (/v1/submit-proof) to verify the proof trustlessly.
- **On-Chain Settlement**: If verified, anchor the new state commitment on-chain (Solana program in collateral_vault) to approve loans or unlock collateral.

Run the demo: `ts-node collateral_demo.ts` (requires ZKCG API running locally).

This pipeline ensures fast off-chain processing (~340ms E2E for Halo2) with on-chain immutability.

## Live Demo API (Stateless)

The ZKCG verifier exposes **demo-only, stateless endpoints** that allow anyone to try proof generation and verification without running the stack locally.

> ⚠️ These endpoints are for **testing and demonstration only**.  
> They do **not** persist protocol state and are **rate-limited**.

**Base URL**
```
https://zkcg-production.up.railway.app
```

## Proof-Based Compliance Evaluation API (For Sponsers Only)

This endpoint exposes a **deterministic, proof-backed compliance oracle**.  
It evaluates a predefined policy over supplied inputs and returns:

- The policy decision
- The reasons for failure (if any)
- A cryptographic proof that the policy was evaluated correctly

⚠️ **Important**  
This service does **not** source data, perform KYC, or assess fraud.  
It proves *correct execution of policy logic* over caller-supplied claims.

---

### Endpoint

```
POST /v1/compliance/evaluate
Content-Type: application/json
```

---

### Request Schema

```json
{
  "applicant_id": "string",
  "risk_score": "number (0–100)",
  "threshold": "number (0–100)",
  "monthly_income_cents": "number (> 0)",
  "monthly_debt_cents": "number (>= 0)",
  "requested_credit_cents": "number (>= 0)"
}
```

---

### Field Semantics

| Field | Description |
|-----|------------|
| `applicant_id` | Caller-defined identifier for the subject being evaluated |
| `risk_score` | Precomputed risk score supplied by the caller |
| `threshold` | Maximum acceptable risk score |
| `monthly_income_cents` | Claimed monthly income (in cents) |
| `monthly_debt_cents` | Claimed monthly debt obligations (in cents) |
| `requested_credit_cents` | Credit amount being evaluated (in cents) |

All numeric values are treated as **claims** and are not independently verified.

---

### Deterministic Policy Rules

The following rules are evaluated:

1. **Risk Score Policy**
   ```
   risk_score ≤ threshold
   ```

2. **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Policy**
   ```
   (monthly_debt / monthly_income) ≤ 45%
   ```

3. **Credit-to-Income Policy**
   ```
   (requested_credit / monthly_income) ≤ 300%
   ```

All calculations use **fixed-point basis points (bps)** for deterministic execution.

---

### Example Request

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/compliance/evaluate \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "applicant_id":"cust_001",
    "risk_score":35,
    "threshold":50,
    "monthly_income_cents":500000,
    "monthly_debt_cents":150000,
    "requested_credit_cents":1000000
  }'
```

---

### Example Response

```json
{
  "application_id": "cust_001-35",
  "decision": "approved",
  "policy_passed": true,
  "risk_band": "medium",
  "reasons": [],
  "proof_verified": true,
  "proof": "<PROOF>"
}
```

---

### Proof Semantics (Oracle Replacement)

The returned proof attests that:

> The declared policy rules were evaluated correctly over the supplied inputs and resulted in the reported outcome.

The proof guarantees:
- Deterministic policy execution
- Correct rule evaluation
- No reliance on trusted oracles

The proof does **not** guarantee:
- Correctness of inputs
- Identity validity
- Data freshness
- Absence of fraud

These are intentionally out of scope.


---

## Notes

- Demo endpoints are **stateless**
- No protocol state is mutated
- Intended for:
  - quick testing
  - integration experiments
  - understanding the proof flow
- Production / protocol endpoints are gated separately

---

## What This Demonstrates

- End-to-end proof generation
- Compact proof size
- Deterministic verification
- Clean HTTP boundary for ZK systems
